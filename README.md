# DCGAN_MNIST

This repository contains code for training and generating images using a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) on the MNIST dataset.

## Files

- **DCGAN.py**: Contains the implementation of the DCGAN model along with training and image generation functions.
- **main.py**: Imports the DCGAN model and provides options for training the model or generating images.

## Why DCGAN Might Perform Worse on MNIST

While DCGANs are powerful architectures for generating images, they may not always perform optimally on certain datasets like MNIST. Here's why:

1. **Dataset Size**: MNIST consists of small, grayscale images of handwritten digits, which may not fully benefit from the hierarchical feature learning capability of convolutional layers.

2. **Complexity**: DCGANs introduce convolutional layers, which add complexity to the model. For simpler datasets like MNIST, fully connected networks might yield better results due to their simplicity and efficiency.

3. **Feature Hierarchies**: MNIST digits are relatively simple and may not require complex hierarchical feature representations. In such cases, fully connected networks might suffice.

4. **Hyperparameters**: DCGANs require careful tuning of hyperparameters. If these hyperparameters are not chosen appropriately for the MNIST dataset, the DCGAN might fail to converge or produce poor quality images.

In summary, while DCGANs are powerful models for image generation tasks, their effectiveness depends on the characteristics of the dataset. For MNIST, experimenting with different architectures and hyperparameters is essential to determine the most suitable model.
